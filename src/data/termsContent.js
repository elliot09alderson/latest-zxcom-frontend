        'Each promoter pack has a maximum limit on the number of merchants and sub-promoters you can onboard. You cannot exceed this limit unless you upgrade to a higher pack.',

        '   • A one-time commission when you successfully onboard a new merchant and their payment is confirmed.',
        '   • A recurring monthly commission for every active merchant in your network, as long as their subscription remains active and paid.',
        '   • An area-manager override commission on merchants onboarded by sub-promoters in your network — only applicable once you reach Area Manager rank, and only for merchants in the two-level chain directly under you.',
        'Commissions are credited to your Zxcom wallet after the onboarded merchant\'s payment is verified and their account is activated.',
        'IMPORTANT — GST exclusion: Commission is calculated on the GST-EXCLUSIVE (taxable) value of the merchant pack, NOT on the gross price the merchant paid. Pack prices on the platform are inclusive of 18% GST. We reverse-extract the GST portion before computing commission. Example: a ₹1,000 pack inclusive of 18% GST has a taxable base of ₹847.46, so a 10% commission rate yields ₹84.75. This is in line with Indian accounting practice — no commission can be earned on the tax that the platform collects on the government\'s behalf.',
        'IMPORTANT: Recurring merchant commissions are tied to the merchant\'s active subscription. The moment your merchant unsubscribes, defaults on payment, or is suspended by admin, your recurring commission from that merchant will stop immediately — even if you onboarded them earlier.',

        'Admin reserves the exclusive right to change promoter pack prices, merchant pack prices, commission percentages, rank thresholds (e.g. Area Manager targets), and any related reward rules at any time.',
        'Changes to commission structure apply from the effective date of the change. Commissions already credited before a change will not be retroactively adjusted unless they were credited in error or fraud.',

        'Minimum payout thresholds may apply. Amounts below the threshold will be carried forward to the next cycle.',
        'TDS (Tax Deducted at Source): Zxcom deducts TDS at 2% on every payout under Section 194H (Commission/Brokerage) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, before disbursement. The deducted amount is deposited with the Government and reflected in your Form 26AS / AIS. You can claim this as a credit when you file your annual income tax return. If you have not provided a valid PAN, TDS will be deducted at 20% under Section 206AA.',
        'Payout gateway charges: Razorpay/RazorpayX or other bank-rail charges (typically ₹3–₹10 per transaction depending on rail and amount) will be deducted from your payout amount. The exact deduction will be visible in your wallet history before you confirm each payout request.',
        'Net amount you receive = Gross requested − TDS − Gateway charges. Your wallet is debited by the gross amount; the TDS portion is retained by Zxcom for deposit to the Government, and the gateway fee covers the actual cost of disbursement.',
